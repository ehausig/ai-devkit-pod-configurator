# Universal Development Guidelines

## Communication Style

Please communicate in a conversational, helpful manner similar to Claude chat. Be clear and informative while maintaining a friendly tone. Provide context for decisions and explain complex concepts when needed.

## Git Commit Conventions

Follow the Conventional Commits specification (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Allowed Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that don't affect code meaning (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process, auxiliary tools, or maintenance tasks
- `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- `build`: Changes affecting build system or external dependencies

### Guidelines:
- Subject line: max 50 characters, imperative mood ("add" not "added")
- Body: wrap at 72 characters, explain what and why (not how)
- Footer: reference issues, breaking changes with `BREAKING CHANGE:`
- Scope is optional but encouraged when relevant

### Examples:
```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 integration

Implement OAuth2 flow for third-party authentication providers.
Supports Google and GitHub initially.

Closes #123
```

```
fix: prevent race condition in data sync

The synchronization logic now uses proper mutex locking to prevent
concurrent writes to the shared data structure.
```

## Code Philosophy

### General Principles
- **Start Simple**: Write the simplest solution that works correctly
- **Iterate Thoughtfully**: Only add abstractions when complexity demands it
- **Be Idiomatic**: Follow the conventions and patterns of the language
- **Clarity First**: Readable code is better than clever code

### Development Approach
- Use Test-Driven Development (TDD) when appropriate
- Test and commit frequently
- Do not push commits to GitHub until unit and integration tests succeed
- For multi-project endeavors, focus on dependent systems first (e.g. APIs before UIs)
- Write unit tests with language-appropriate framework
- Write integration tests with `expect` scripts
- Avoid premature optimization and over-engineering
- Apply SOLID principles only when they add clear value

### Creating an Editing files
When creating a new file, avoid permissions errors by:
1. Create the parent folder first (e.g. `mkdir -p <parent path>`)  
2. Create a blank file with `touch` command
3. Read() the empty file and then Edit() it

When editing an existing file:
1. Read() the file then Edit() it to avoid permissions errors

Never create or edit files above the `~/workspace/` or `/home/devuser/workspace` directory

### Code Quality
- Use descriptive, meaningful variable and function names
- Follow language-specific naming conventions and be idiomatic
- Add comments for complex algorithms or business logic
- Keep functions focused and reasonably sized
- Handle errors appropriately for the language and context

## Project Structure

### Workspace Organization
- The `~/workspace` directory contains individual project folders
- Each project should have its own subdirectory under `~/workspace`
- Initialize git repositories at the project root level (e.g., `~/workspace/my-project/`), never directly in `~/workspace`
- Follow language-specific conventions for internal project structure

### Example Structure:
```
~/workspace/
├── project-one/
│   ├── .git/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── [language-specific structure]
├── project-two/
│   ├── .git/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── [language-specific structure]
└── experiments/
    └── [unversioned experimental code]
```

### Navigation Best Practices
- **Use relative paths**: Navigate with `cd ../project` instead of `/home/devuser/workspace/project`
- **Stay within workspace**: All project work should be under `~/workspace/`
- **Avoid absolute paths**: Security model prevents absolute path navigation

## Documentation Standards

### README.md Template
Create a README.md with the following initial structure:

```markdown
# Project Name

Brief description of what this project does and why it exists.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- List any requirements

### Installation
\```bash
# Installation commands
\```

### Usage
\```bash
# Basic usage examples
\```

## Development

### Setup
Steps for development environment setup

### Testing
How to run tests

### Contributing
<!-- Guidelines for contributing to the project -->

## API Documentation
<!-- API endpoint documentation -->

## Deployment
<!-- Deployment instructions and considerations -->

## License

[License type] - see LICENSE file for details
```

### Documentation Guidelines
- Start with a minimal README and expand as the project matures
- Document complex algorithms inline with clear comments
- Use language-specific documentation formats (JSDoc, docstrings, etc.)
- Rely on git commit messages as the changelog during development
- Maintain a JOURNAL.md file in the ~/workspace/ folder and append to it
important decisions, milestones, and blockers as you perform your work.

## Security Considerations

### File System Access
- **Never** access or manipulate files outside of the claude user's home directory (~)
- All file operations should be contained within ~/workspace or other subdirectories of ~
- Do not attempt to access the host file system outside the container
- If a task requires access outside ~, explain the limitation and suggest alternatives

### General Security Practices
- Never commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- Use environment variables for configuration secrets
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Follow OWASP guidelines for web applications
- Keep dependencies updated for security patches

## Dependency Management

### Philosophy
- **Start Minimal**: Only add dependencies that provide substantial value
- **Security First**: Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- **Version Stability**: Pin exact versions in lock files for reproducibility
- **Regular Maintenance**: Update dependencies periodically, testing thoroughly
- **License Compliance**: Ensure all dependencies are compatible with project license
- **Prefer Standard**: Use language standard library when reasonable

### Guidelines
- Document why each dependency is needed
- Evaluate the maintenance status of dependencies
- Consider the size and complexity added by each dependency
- Group dependency updates into logical commits
- **Check compatibility first**: Verify version compatibility before adding dependencies
- **Test after adding**: Always run tests after adding new dependencies

### Common Dependency Issues and Solutions

#### Rust Async Crate Compatibility
When using multiple async crates together, version conflicts are common:
```toml
# Known working combinations:
[dependencies]
async-graphql = { version = "5.0", features = ["chrono"] }
async-graphql-axum = "5.0"
axum = "0.6"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
async-trait = "0.1"

# Use cargo tree to check for conflicts:
# cargo tree -d  # Shows duplicate dependencies
```

#### Python Virtual Environments
Always use virtual environments to avoid conflicts:
```bash
# Create and activate before installing
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Node.js Lock Files
Always commit package-lock.json for reproducible builds:
```bash
npm ci  # Use instead of npm install in CI/production
```

## Code Review Preferences

When reviewing code changes:
- **Correctness**: Ensure the code does what it's supposed to do
- **Readability**: Code should be clear and self-documenting
- **Maintainability**: Consider future developers (including yourself)
- **Testing**: Verify adequate test coverage for new functionality and that all the tests have succeeded
- **Security**: Look for potential vulnerabilities or unsafe practices
- **Performance**: Flag obvious performance issues, but avoid premature optimization
- **Conventions**: Ensure consistency with project standards

Provide constructive feedback with specific suggestions for improvement.

## Git Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention
Use descriptive branch names that align with the change type:
- `feat/short-description` - New features
- `fix/issue-number-description` - Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/123-login-error`)
- `chore/description` - Maintenance tasks
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring
- `test/description` - Test additions or updates

### GitHub Repository Setup
When creating repositories with Claude Code, configure them for efficient autonomous workflow:

1. **Enable Auto-merge**: Allow PRs to be automatically merged when checks pass
   ```bash
   gh repo edit --enable-auto-merge
   ```

2. **Disable PR approval requirements** for personal/development repos:
   ```bash
   # Via GitHub UI: Settings → Branches → Edit protection rules
   # Uncheck "Require pull request reviews before merging"
   # Or set "Required approving reviews" to 0
   ```
3. Always prompt the user for which license (MIT, Apache, etc.) they would like 
to use and ensure that the corresponding LICENSE file exists in the root of the 
repo in GitHub upon initialization

## Recommended Solo Developer Workflow
For maximum efficiency when working alone with Claude Code:
```bash
# 1. Create feature branch and make changes
git checkout -b feat/new-feature
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement new feature"

# 2. Push and create PR with auto-merge
git push -u origin feat/new-feature
gh pr create --title "feat: implement new feature" --body "Description"
gh pr merge --auto --squash --delete-branch

# 3. Or for simpler flow, work directly on main
git checkout main
# ... make changes ...
git commit -am "feat: implement new feature"
git push
```

### Pull Request Template
When creating PRs, include:
```markdown

### Using Expect for Testing and Automation

The environment includes `expect` and `autoexpect` tools for automating interactive 
programs, such as TUIs and CLIs, as well as integration tests. Use these tools to enhance development autonomy:

#### When to Use Expect
- **Testing TUI applications**: Automate user input for text-based interfaces
- **API client testing**: Script interactive authentication or configuration flows  
- **CLI tool validation**: Test command-line tools that require user input
- **Setup automation**: Handle installation wizards or configuration prompts
- **Regression testing**: Ensure interactive flows work consistently

#### Basic Expect Patterns

**Simple interaction script** (`test_interactive.exp`):
```tcl
#!/usr/bin/expect -f
set timeout 10

spawn ./my_tui_app
expect "Enter username:"
send "testuser\r"
expect "Enter password:"  
send "testpass\r"
expect "Main menu>"
send "1\r"
expect eof
```

**Using autoexpect to record interactions**:
```bash
# Record an interaction session
autoexpect -f test_session.exp ./my_interactive_app
# This creates test_session.exp with your recorded actions

# Edit and clean up the generated script
vim test_session.exp

# Run the recorded script
expect test_session.exp
```

**Testing API client with expect**:
```tcl
#!/usr/bin/expect -f
spawn python api_client.py

expect "API endpoint:"
send "https://api.example.com\r"

expect "Authentication method"
send "2\r"  ;# Choose OAuth

expect "Client ID:"
send "$env(CLIENT_ID)\r"

expect "Client Secret:"
send "$env(CLIENT_SECRET)\r"

expect ">"
send "GET /users\r"

expect {
    "200 OK" { puts "API test passed" }
    timeout { puts "API test failed - timeout" }
}
```

#### Best Practices for Expect Scripts
1. **Set appropriate timeouts**: Use `set timeout` for operations that might take time
2. **Handle multiple outcomes**: Use `expect { pattern1 {} pattern2 {} }` syntax
3. **Use environment variables**: For sensitive data like passwords or API keys
4. **Make scripts idempotent**: Ensure they can run multiple times safely
5. **Add error handling**: Check for unexpected responses or failures
6. **Comment thoroughly**: Explain what each interaction is testing

#### Integration with Development Workflow
- Create `tests/expect/` directory for expect scripts
- Name scripts descriptively: `test_auth_flow.exp`, `test_menu_navigation.exp`
- Run expect tests as part of your test suite:
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  # run_tui_tests.sh
  for test in tests/expect/*.exp; do
      echo "Running $test..."
      expect "$test" || exit 1
  done
  ```

#### Example: TUI App Development Workflow
```bash
# 1. Develop TUI feature
python tui_app.py

# 2. Record interaction for testing
autoexpect -f tests/expect/feature_test.exp python tui_app.py

# 3. Clean up and enhance the generated script
vim tests/expect/feature_test.exp

# 4. Add to automated test suite
echo "expect tests/expect/feature_test.exp" >> run_tests.sh
```

#### Testing Best Practices
- **Run tests immediately**: Execute tests as soon as they're created
- **Test integration early**: Don't wait until the end to test component interaction
- **Use expect for validation**: Automate checking of interactive flows
- **Document test failures**: Keep notes on what went wrong for future reference

By actively using expect for testing interactive programs, you can develop more robust TUI applications and API clients with comprehensive automated testing, reducing manual testing burden and catching regressions early.

## Common Development Blockers and Solutions

Based on real-world experience, here are common issues and their solutions:

### 1. Dependency Version Conflicts
**Problem**: Incompatible versions between related packages
**Solution**: 
- Check compatibility before adding dependencies
- Use `cargo tree -d` (Rust) or `npm ls` (Node.js) to identify conflicts
- Pin specific versions when mixing async crates or complex dependencies

### 2. Environment Activation Issues
**Problem**: Standard activation commands fail (e.g., conda activate)
**Solution**:
- For conda: Use `eval "$(conda shell.bash hook)"` before activate
- For Python venv: Always use `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Test environment commands before building workflows around them

### 3. Path Navigation Restrictions
**Problem**: Security model blocks absolute paths
**Solution**:
- Use relative paths: `cd ../other-project` instead of `/home/devuser/workspace/other-project`
- Stay within ~/workspace/ for all project work
- Use `pwd` to verify current location

### 4. Missing Dependencies
**Problem**: Forgetting commonly needed but not obvious dependencies
**Common misses**:
- Rust: `async-trait` when using async traits
- Python: Development tools (black, ruff, mypy)
- Node.js: Testing frameworks (jest, supertest)

### 5. Testing Delays
**Problem**: Creating tests but not running them immediately
**Solution**:
- Run tests as part of the development flow
- Use watch modes: `cargo watch -x test`, `npm run test:watch`
- Create simple "hello world" tests first to verify setup
